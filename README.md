Requirements
High Level

    Create a RESTful service with two endpoints:
        An endpoint to start a game. Two simulated players will play out the game.
        An endpoint to get lifetime wins for each player stored in a database.

    You should include some basic tests along with the application code.

Technical

    The service can be created in the language/framework of your choice. However, please do not reuse boilerplate code from another project as this makes it hard to see the pieces you have created which is a goal of this exercise.
    You can use any db technology you like.

Bonuses for providing:

    A Docker image or a link to a cloud deployment of the service.
    A simple UI showing the game being played.
    You can also implement variations of the basic game if you have time.

Submission

    Your submission should be accessible in a public git repository that includes a README.md with all the pertinent information of how to run your application. The expectation is that we can easily follow the steps provided and run the application without any guesswork.

    If your submission does include additional artifacts that are not represented within the repository - the README should provide information on how to retrieve and access these items.

    Details on anything further that you would like to achieve given more time, including any trade-offs that you may have made.

Good luck and thank you for your time - we look forward to seeing your submission.
